# Welcome to BeamOpticsAnalysis

BeamOpticsAnalysis is dedicated to developing an ecosystem of particle accelerator optics analysis Python packages, used in the Accelerator and Beam Physics (ABP) group at CERN.

The packages within this organisation can be described as follows:
* [boa](https://github.com/beamopticsanalysis/boa): An empty package to easily install the various tools of this ecosystem. One can think of boa as the [xsuite](https://github.com/xsuite/xsuite) of this organisation.
* [cpymadtools](https://github.com/beamopticsanalysis/cpymadtools): A lightweigth pythonic wrapper around `cpymad` for conveniently running `MAD-X` studies.
